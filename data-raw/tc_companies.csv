To do this, we partner with organizations that teach programming, such as CoderDojo. These programs are instrumental for developing the next generation of thinkers and builders, but these classes only scratch the surface and create exposure to coding. Giving a child ownership of her own laptop emboldens her to immerse herself in learning. Plus, it’s hard to become a hacker when you only get to code for an hour once a week on a borrowed piece of equipment. On our website (codestarter.org), we crowdfund one laptop at a time. Every time we hit $250 in donations, we will ship a Chromebook pre-loaded with Linux to a child who is waiting to enroll in a programming class. When the child receives her laptop, she’ll send you a thank-you note, and you’ll get quarterly updates on her progress for the first year as she learns to code. We want to provide complete transparency, so we’ll also give you access to our evaluation data. This way you can check in and see the long-term impact of giving laptops to kids and empowering them to code. Think back to when you got your first computer. How old were you? Did that opportunity make a difference in your life? If it did, and you or your company wants to give that same opportunity to some really great kids, join us! At Codestarter, we want to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn how to code. And it all starts with a computer."

Behind the scenes our billing system charges you for each hour that a droplet is active. This allows you to spin up and spin down droplets as necessary and only be charged for the period that you use them. Up And Running In Seconds We built our control panel to be the easiest to use. Simply enter in a droplet name, select a region and a droplet size and you’re ready to go. No need to figure out partition schemes, swap, or deal with complicated and hard to figure out application images. Any Stack Using our pre-built images you can launch any number of developer stacks. From the most common LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and Ruby on RAILs (Apache RAILs MySQL) to more specific stacks. Such as a RAILs stack built on Nginx and Passenger for increased performance. Or a MongoDB standalone stack to utilize a NoSQL backend for one of your applications. You can also create your own application stacks and deploy them to the cloud through our easy to use interface. Fast Performance! Every cloud still runs on hardware and while the commodity approach is great for fault tolerance it creates performance slow downs when slower SATA disks are used. That’s why we decided to launch our cloud using SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) drives that provide 2x – 3x better performance than traditional SATA drives. You can also sign up to be one of the first beta testers of our soon to be launched SSD cloud. Easy Control Panel Fast, easy to use, and best of all, no complicated settings to manage. Launching a droplet is as easy as selecting a size and giving it a name. There are no complex settings to manage. Best of all we’ve spent countless hours using the interface ourselves to ensure that everything you would do on a daily basis would be front and center."

Classical approaches to internet parental control solutions have required parents to be an IT pro to download, install, configure and manage software that is installed on the device to be controlled. However, in today’s modern internet home kids are accessing the internet from a litany of devices from within the home (PCs, phones, mp3 players, tablets, game consoles, …). As a result parents are struggling to keep up. Clearly, a device-centric, software-based parental control solution is no longer practical. WebCurfew's approach is 100% cloud-based, talking directly to the routers people already have in their home. WebCurfew “programs” these routers to turn off access to any internet enabled device that connects to it. Our platform for remote controlling consumer routers allows us to create a single intuitive ""Control Panel"" abstraction on a web page/mobile phone for displaying all of the internet enabled devices in the home. Parents can then turn off/on the internet access for each device, in real-time at a click of a button. It’s like having a separate ""light switch"" for all your kids internet devices. WebCurfew is the world’s first global consumer-oriented home automation application. However, rather than controlling small appliances and living room lights, WebCurfew users are controlling the internet access to their children's devices.
